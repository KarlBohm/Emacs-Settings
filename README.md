# Karl BÃ¶hm's Emacs setting

I'm currently learning Emacs as well as Emacs Lisp. This repository is used to sync my settings and record my progress.

Most of my settings are adopted form [this](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/441612281) guide. Packages settings are generally modified from the README of the pacakges respectively. 

### TODO

- [ ] C and C++ completion

- [ ] Haskell support

- [ ] More packages
