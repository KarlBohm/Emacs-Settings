# Karl BÃ¶hm's Emacs setting

I'm currently learning Emacs as well as Emacs Lisp. This repository is used to sync my settings and record my progress.

Most of my settings are adopted form [this](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/441612281) guide. Package settings are generally modified from the README of the pacakges respectively. 

Default fonts is written in `./lisp/common.el` without setting fallbacks, so **Sarasa Mono Slab** and **LXGW WenKai** need to be installed before using this configuration. 

### TODO

- [ ] C and C++ completion

- [x] Haskell support

- [ ] More packages

- [ ] Find out whether to use HLS or Haskell-mode

- [x] Proof General support

- [ ] Change structure in order to avoid hard-coded paths for `projectile.el`
